###Interactive Python Import Graph Visualization with Cohere API
This Python script generates an interactive graph visualization of a Python codebase's import structure. It clones a GitHub repository, builds an import dependency graph, and uses the Cohere API to generate brief descriptions for each module's code. The graph can be viewed in a browser, where you can hover over each module node to see the corresponding code snippet and description.

Features
GitHub Repo Cloning: Automatically clones a GitHub repository for analysis.
Import Graph Creation: Builds a directed graph of the import relationships between Python modules in the codebase.
Cohere API Integration: Extracts and summarizes code from each Python module, providing a brief description using Cohere's language model.
Interactive Visualization: Visualizes the import graph in a browser, where each node displays the module's name, code snippet, and description on hover.
Codebase Analysis: Analyzes the codebase to provide insights such as the most imported module, isolated modules, and circular dependencies.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Internet access (for cloning GitHub repos and calling the Cohere API)
Cohere API key
The following Python packages:
networkx
pyvis
cohere
argparse
subprocess
ast
webbrowser
html
Installation
Clone this repository (if necessary):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
cd your-repo-directory
Install the dependencies:

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install networkx pyvis cohere
Set up the Cohere API:

Sign up for a Cohere API key.

Add your API key to the script by setting the cohere_api_key variable:

python
Copy code
cohere_api_key = 'YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY'
Usage
Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Run the script from the command line, passing the GitHub repository URL you wish to analyze:

bash
Copy code
python codeGen_challenge.py <repo_url> --output <output_file>
<repo_url>: URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone and analyze.
--output <output_file>: (Optional) The name of the HTML file where the graph visualization will be saved. Default is import_graph.html.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python codeGen_challenge.py https://github.com/user/repository --output repo_import_graph.html
This will clone the GitHub repository, generate the import graph, and save the interactive visualization in repo_import_graph.html.

Output
The output will be an interactive HTML file where:

Each node represents a module in the repository.
Hovering over a node will show:
Module Name
Code Snippet (first 10 lines of the module)
Description (generated by Cohere API based on the code snippet)
The graph is automatically opened in your default browser once the analysis is complete.

Analysis Information:
The script also provides basic insights into the codebase:

Total number of modules
Total number of imports
The most imported module
The module with the most dependencies
Number of isolated modules
Whether there are any circular dependencies
Example Workflow
Clone a GitHub Repo: The script clones the repository into a temporary directory.
Build Import Graph: It analyzes the .py files, extracts their imports, and constructs a directed graph representing the dependencies between modules.
Generate Descriptions: The Cohere API generates brief descriptions of the code in each file.
Visualize Graph: The interactive graph is generated and saved as an HTML file. Nodes display the code snippet and description when hovered over.
Analyze the Codebase: Basic statistics about the codebase are printed in the terminal.
Example Graph Visualization
Here is an example of how the graph might look:

Nodes represent modules.
Edges show the import relationships between modules.
Hovering on a node reveals a code snippet and description.
Troubleshooting
Cohere API Errors: Ensure your Cohere API key is valid and your internet connection is active.
File Read Errors: Make sure the Python files in the repository are properly formatted.
Module Graph Doesn't Load: If the HTML graph file doesn't open automatically, try opening it manually in your browser.
Future Improvements
Expand the analysis to include more complex codebase metrics.
Add support for other programming languages.
Improve the description generation by using more advanced natural language processing models.
